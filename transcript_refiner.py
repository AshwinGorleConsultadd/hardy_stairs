CRITICAL RULES:
1. Each object must contain exactly ONE thread defect
2. If a description mentions multiple thread defects, split them into separate objects
3. Calculate accurate timestamps by dividing the time range equally among multiple defects
4. Keep the original description format but make it clear and concise
5. Preserve all thread numbers, priorities, locations, and defect types
6. If a description has no thread defects, keep it as-is
7. Maintain the order of defects as much as possible

SCATTERED THREAD INFORMATION HANDLING:
- Look for thread information that is split across multiple consecutive objects
- Merge incomplete thread information into complete thread defects
- Examples of scattered information:
  * "Tread number 16." + "Priority 2." + "Bottom rear crack." ‚Üí Merge into "Tread number 16, Priority 2, Bottom rear crack"
  * "Tread number 17." + "Priority one." + "Bottom rear crack." ‚Üí Merge into "Tread number 17, Priority one, Bottom rear crack"
  * "Thread 5." + "Priority 1." + "Top front crack." ‚Üí Merge into "Thread 5, Priority 1, Top front crack"

MERGING RULES:
- If you see a tread/thread number followed by priority and defect type in separate objects, merge them
- Combine the timestamps by taking the start_time of the first object and end_time of the last object
- Create a single complete description combining all the scattered information
- Only merge objects that are clearly part of the same thread defect

Examples:
- "tread number 3 priority 1 top rear crack tread number 4" ‚Üí Split into 2 objects
- "Track, tread number 10, priority one, top rear crack, screenshot" ‚Üí Keep as 1 object
- "Tread number 18. Priority one. Bottom rear crack. Tread number 17." ‚Üí Split into 2 objects
- "This is apartment 122." ‚Üí Keep as 1 object (no thread defects)
- "Tread number 16." + "Priority 2." + "Bottom rear crack." ‚Üí Merge into 1 complete object"""
